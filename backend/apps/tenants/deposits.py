"""
How large a rent security deposit a letting should hold.

One rule, one place. It was previously spelled ``monthly_rent * 3`` inside
``check_data_integrity`` and again inside ``apply_matasia_answers``, and the
tenant API did not know about it at all — so the deposit card showed what was
held with nothing to hold it against, and a residential deposit could sit at
zero indefinitely without anything saying so.

The policy is one month's rent everywhere except the commercial arcade, which
takes three. Matasia Commercial is the only BUSINESS-classified building in the
portfolio, so classification is the distinction the code keys on rather than a
building code: that keeps a future commercial letting on the three-month rule
without anyone having to remember to add it here, and it is the same axis the
VAT and receipt-layout logic already turns on.

``deposit_paid`` records what was actually received and is never adjusted to
match this rule. Where the two differ the shortfall is a fact worth keeping,
not a number to round up to policy — MCG05 sat at 390,780 against an expected
259,500 for a month precisely because an odd figure went unquestioned.

A letting may nonetheless have been agreed at a figure the rule does not
produce. ``Tenant.agreed_deposit`` records that agreement, and where it is set
it — not the rule — is what the deposit is held against, so the page stops
reporting a shortfall against money nobody owes. It is an override, not a
default: blank is the normal state and the rule below still governs everyone
else.
