Posting service — pure functions that build balanced double-entry journal entries.

Every public function returns a saved JournalEntry with balanced JournalLines.
The idempotency UniqueConstraint on (source_type, source_id, kind) ensures
that re-running posting for the same Payment/Expense never creates duplicates.

ACCOUNTING POLICY — ACCRUAL BASIS
─────────────────────────────────
Income is recognised when it is billed, not when the cash arrives (IFRS 15/16,
and the VAT tax point for a let is the invoice). The tenant's account, 1040,
therefore moves exactly as the tenant's statement does:

  rent billed (Arrears row)      DR 1040            / CR 4110|4120 + CR 2600 VAT
  rent waived                    DR 4110|4120 + 2600 / CR 1040
  water / other charge billed    DR 1040            / CR 4150
  credit note, concession, …     DR <by reason>     / CR 1040
  any tenant receipt (not a      DR 1020            / CR 1040
    deposit)
  refund paid out                DR 1040            / CR 1020
  opening position carried in    DR 1040            / CR 3300 Retained Earnings

so the 1040 balance always equals the sum of the tenant balances on the rent
roll (``apps.payments.monthly_ledger.current_balances``) — the debtors list an
auditor ties the receivable to. A tenant in credit leaves a credit balance in
1040; the balance sheet shows that as a liability (tenant prepayments).

Security deposits never touch income: DR 1030 / CR 2100.

# ── Tenant credits and refunds ──────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The tenant side of every credit is 1040, the tenant's account. What is debited
# depends on WHY the credit exists:
#
#   billing correction / rent concession  DR income (4110/4120/4150) + 2600 VAT
#   tenant paid a cost that was ours      DR the expense category's account
#   credit owed from before the books     DR 3300 Retained Earnings
#
# Applying a credit to a month's rent moves nothing in the ledger: the rent was
# recognised when it was billed and the credit already sits in 1040, so setting
# one against the other is the tenant's statement, not a journal.
#
# A refund pays a credit balance out: DR 1040 / CR 1020. That holds whether the
# credit came from a credit note or from overpaid rent — under accrual an
# overpayment is a credit balance in 1040, never income.
