"""
Combined commercial spaces — several units let and billed as one.

The units must be vacant commercial units in the same building; they need not
be next to each other or on the same floor. A hospital that takes MCG05–MCG08
pays one rent, on one paybill account, under
one tenancy. Rather than a second tenancy model, the space is the head unit
plus the units that point at it through ``Unit.combined_into``:

  * the tenancy stays on the head, so billing, statements, arrears, credits and
    the ledger — all of which hang off ``Tenant.unit`` — are unchanged;
  * the other units mirror the head's status (``Unit.save``), so occupancy
    counts them as let and none of them can be let separately;
  * when the tenancy ends the space is released (``release_space``, called
    from move-out): every unit goes back to vacant and lettable on its own;
  * a payment quoting any unit in the space reaches the tenant (the matcher
    resolves a member to its head);
  * the rent that bills is still ``Tenant.monthly_rent``. Adding or removing a
    unit moves it by that unit's standing rent unless the landlord agrees a
    different figure, and the change is written to the financial audit log.

The rent is picked up by the next billing run. Months already charged are not
restated — the same rule as editing a tenant's rent by hand.
