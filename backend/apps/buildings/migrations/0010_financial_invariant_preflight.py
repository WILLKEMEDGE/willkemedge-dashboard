"""Pre-flight for the database-level financial invariants.

This is the HEAD of the constraint chain: `expenses/0010`, `tenants/0006` and
`payments/0019` all depend on it (directly or transitively), so it runs before
any CHECK or UNIQUE constraint is installed anywhere.

It changes nothing. It scans live data against every rule those migrations are
about to enforce and, if anything is broken, raises with the offending row ids
so the deploy stops BEFORE the schema is touched.

Why refuse rather than repair
-----------------------------
`0018_arrears_check_constraints` established a "heal, then constrain" pattern
for an arrears balance that was safe to clamp at zero. These rules are not like
that: each one guards an AMOUNT or a PERIOD on a financial record, and silently
rewriting either is restating the books. A migration must never do that
unattended. The operator gets the list, decides, corrects the rows deliberately,
and redeploys.

Failing here is safe. `build.sh` runs under `set -o errexit`, so the release
aborts and Render keeps serving the previous deploy — nothing goes down and no
schema change is half-applied.

Run `python manage.py check_db_invariants` against production first to find out
whether this will pass, before you deploy.
