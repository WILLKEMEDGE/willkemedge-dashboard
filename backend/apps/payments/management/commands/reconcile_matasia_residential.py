"""
Bring Matasia Residential into line with the 21 Aug 2026 rent statement.

The commercial twin of this command is ``reconcile_matasia_commercial``; this
one repairs the residential half of the same building. Two differences matter:

  * Residential units carry NO VAT. Every ``expected_vat`` written here is 0.
  * The sheet's "Water + Other Costs" column is a real monthly charge that was
    never posted. MR202 is the worked example the owner raised: 1,800 of water
    on the statement, nothing in the system, so the tenant reads as owing 1,800
    less than she does and the water is never recovered.

Why the rent roll reads wrong today
-----------------------------------
Same root cause as commercial. The June 2026 cutover posted an ``opening_ar``
journal entry per tenant, but only for the tenancies that existed then, and it
put the figure in the GL rather than the arrears subledger. Matasia was loaded
in July and got neither, so no residential tenancy has a July arrears row: the
monthly rent roll starts its roll-forward at zero and every "B/Forward" shows
0.00.

That cuts both ways here. MR307 is carrying 6,000 forward and reads as settled.
MR306 is 20,000 in credit and reads as owing a full 22,000 — money the tenant
has already paid and is entitled to draw down.

How the opening position is seeded
----------------------------------
``build_monthly_ledger`` derives each month from ``Arrears`` (the charge),
``UtilityCharge`` (other costs) and ``Payment`` (cash) — it does NOT read
``Arrears.balance``. So a July row is created that nets to the statement's
B/Forward:

  * b/f owed (positive) — a July charge of that amount and no payment, so July
    closes owing exactly the brought-forward figure.
  * b/f in credit (negative) — no July charge plus an opening-credit payment of
    the absolute amount, so July closes negative and August draws it down. It
    has to be a Payment row rather than a negative balance: ``Arrears`` carries
    a ``balance >= 0`` check constraint, and the credit is real money the
    tenant is owed the use of.

Both are labelled with ``OPENING_MARKER`` so the roll reports them as brought
forward rather than as a month billed at that figure.

What this command does NOT do
-----------------------------
It never creates a payment to make a row balance. Step 4 rebuilds each August
row and compares it to the statement; a row that does not reconcile is
reported, because a shortfall there means cash is missing from the feed and
inventing it would hide the very thing worth knowing.

DRY-RUN BY DEFAULT. Nothing is written without --apply. Re-running is safe.
