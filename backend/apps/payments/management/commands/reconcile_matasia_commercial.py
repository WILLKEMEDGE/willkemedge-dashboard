"""
Bring Matasia Commercial into line with the 21 Aug 2026 rent statement.

This is the CHARGES side of the cleanup. The cash side — the two missing
payments, the MCG06 duplicate and the Fortcom quarterly split — lives in
``reconcile_aug_2026``. Both are idempotent, so either order works, but running
that one first makes this one's payment column reconcile.

Why the rent roll reads wrong today
-----------------------------------
Not one of the Matasia commercial tenancies has a July arrears row, so the
monthly rent roll starts its roll-forward at zero and every "Arrears b/f" shows
0.00. MCG01 is the worked example: the statement carries 12,000 forward, bills
24,000 + 3,840 VAT, and leaves 12,000 owing after a 27,840 payment. The app
shows b/f 0, total due 27,840, balance 0 — the tenant reads as settled while
owing 12,000, so they drop out of arrears reporting and never get dunned.

The June 2026 cutover posted an ``opening_ar`` journal entry per tenant, but
only for the 29 tenancies that existed then, and it put the figure in the GL
rather than the arrears subledger — which is why ``build_monthly_ledger`` cannot
see it either. Matasia was loaded in July and got neither.

How the opening position is seeded
----------------------------------
``build_monthly_ledger`` derives each month from ``Arrears`` (the charge),
``UtilityCharge`` (other costs) and ``Payment`` (cash) — it does NOT read
``Arrears.balance``. So a July row is created that nets to the statement's
B/Forward:

  * b/f owed (positive) — a July charge of that amount and no payment, so July
    closes owing exactly the brought-forward figure.
  * b/f in credit (negative) — no July charge plus an opening-credit payment of
    the absolute amount, so July closes negative and August draws it down. It
    has to be a Payment row rather than a negative balance: ``Arrears`` carries
    a ``balance >= 0`` check constraint, and the credit is real money the
    tenant is owed the use of.

Both are labelled in the notes so they are never mistaken for a billed month.

DRY-RUN BY DEFAULT. Nothing is written without --apply. Re-running is safe.
