Bring Ignite Access (MCG07) into line with the September 2026 statement.

Three separate faults stack up on this one account, and fixing any of them
alone moves the balance further from the truth rather than closer.

  1. THE DEPOSIT IS BOOKED AS RENT. Ignite paid 180,000 for the security
     deposit on 24 Aug 2026. It went in as a rent receipt, so it is being
     consumed by rent instead of held as a refundable liability, and it posted
     DR 1020 / CR 4120 + CR 2600 — recognising 155,172.41 of commercial rental
     income and declaring 24,827.59 of output VAT on money that has to be given
     back. Nothing offsets it: the "Rent Security Deposit" row on the issued
     statement was typed by hand, not stored, which is why the pair scan in
     ``repair_deposit_miscoding`` finds nothing here.

  2. AUGUST 2026 WAS BILLED AND SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN. The tenancy runs from
     September — the issued statement raises September rent on 31 Aug and shows
     no August charge at all. The August row bills a month the tenant never
     occupied.

  3. OCTOBER 2026 WAS RAISED EARLY. Commercial lettings are billed a month
     ahead on the 25th, so October belongs to the 25 Sept run. It is already
     sitting on the account, dunning the tenant for a month not yet due.

Together they cancel out to something that looks nearly plausible — 28,800 due
where the statement says 69,600 — which is why this survived review:

    August rent + VAT        69,600
    September rent + VAT     69,600
    October rent + VAT       69,600
    less the 180,000        (180,000)
                            ────────
                              28,800     against a statement reading 69,600

Removing a period deletes its Arrears row, and the ledger signal reverses that
row's rent charge (see ``ledger.posting``, arrears section) — so the GL follows
without a step here. (When this ran the books were cash-basis and arrears
carried no entries at all.)

Safety
------
Preview is the DEFAULT. Nothing is written without ``--apply``. Every step
verifies the shape it expects and refuses rather than guessing: a period with
cash against it is never removed, and the payment must still be an unvoided
rent receipt for the expected amount.
