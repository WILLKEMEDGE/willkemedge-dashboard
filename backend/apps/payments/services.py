    already-recorded Payment instead of double-booking (and double-reducing
    arrears). The key is scoped to the TENANT and enforced by a partial unique
    constraint at the DB level, so concurrent retries that both pass the
    pre-check are still caught via IntegrityError. FIFO allocation passes a
    per-chunk key derived from the bank transaction id (see
    `allocate_payment_fifo`), so a replayed credit is de-duplicated there too.

    A stored payment only counts as "the same payment" if the amount and date
    match too. Anything else is a key collision — two different receipts sharing
    a reference — and raises `IdempotencyConflict` rather than silently

    Apply an incoming credit to the tenant's outstanding balances oldest-first.

    Arrears-first rule: the money clears the oldest unpaid period before newer
    ones. One Payment (+Transaction) is created per period the money touches —
    so each period's arrears clear correctly — and any remainder after all known
    arrears is booked to the current period (an overpayment / credit).

    `payment_date` is the date the money was received (the bank's posting date)
    and is the same on every chunk; only the period each chunk *clears* differs.

    Returns the Payment records created, oldest period first. If the tenant has
    no outstanding arrears, this behaves exactly like a single process_payment

    is read), and per-chunk tax handling is whatever process_payment applies.

    Idempotency

    Pass ``idempotency_key`` (the bank's transaction id) to make replaying the

    can't be used verbatim; each chunk gets ``<key>#<n>``, guarded by the
    partial unique constraint on Payment.idempotency_key. Before allocating we
    look for any chunk already carrying this prefix and, if found, return the
    existing rows untouched rather than re-splitting the money.

    The chunk ordinal — not the period — is the discriminator on purpose: FIFO
    legitimately books two chunks to the SAME period when a partial arrear is
    cleared and the remainder spills into the current month, and a period-keyed
    scheme would silently swallow the second one.

    Callers that leave the key blank keep the previous behaviour (no
    de-duplication), so manual back-office entry of a genuine second payment
