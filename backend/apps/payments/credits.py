"""
Tenant credits and refunds — the one place they are created or changed.

Every function here is atomic, locks the tenant first (so two clicks can never
use the same credit twice), posts its journal entry STRICTLY — if the ledger
refuses the entry the whole action rolls back, because a credit that is on the
tenant's account but not in the books is exactly the drift this exists to stop
— and writes an AuditLog row.

Vocabulary, as the owner sees it on the tenant page:

    Add Credit            issue_credit
    Apply to Next Invoice set_hold(hold=False)   — the default for a new credit
    Hold Credit           set_hold(hold=True)
    Refund Credit         create_refund
    Mark as Sent          mark_refund_sent
    Cancel Refund         cancel_refund
    Void Credit / Refund  void_credit / void_refund

The accounting behind each is in ``apps.ledger.posting`` (tenant credits
section). Owner-only today: the owner both creates and approves, and the record
says so (``approval_mode="owner_self"``) so a second approver can be added
later without changing the data.
