Celery tasks for the payments app.

Tasks:
  send_payment_confirmation  — SMS + email after every payment
  recalculate_all_statuses   — nightly unit status sweep
  generate_monthly_arrears   — 25th + 28th (+ 1st catch-up): create arrears records
  send_rent_reminders        — daily: SMS N days before each tenant's due day
  send_arrears_reminders     — daily: SMS on/after due day when rent unpaid
  send_monthly_statements    — 25th + 28th (+ 1st catch-up): statement PDF + summary SMS per tenant
  poll_bank_statement        — hourly fallback for banks without webhooks

Every tenant is invoiced a month ahead, and the two monthly jobs run on two
days because the two kinds of letting are invoiced on different ones: the 25th
for commercial tenants and the 28th for residential ones. Either way the invoice
carries next month's rent and this month's water, and the rent falls due on the
5th. The 1st runs both jobs again as a catch-up. Both jobs read each tenant's
month from ``billing_calendar.tenant_billing_period`` rather than deciding for
themselves — see that module for what else depends on it.

All tasks use bind=True + max_retries=3 with exponential backoff.

      * A COMMERCIAL tenant is billed on the 25th for the month ahead — 25
        September raises October — so the VAT invoice that goes out the same
        morning states an October the ledger has actually charged.
      * A RESIDENTIAL tenant is billed on the 28th for the month ahead. The
        25th run raises nothing new for them; their next month is not due to
        be raised for three more days.

    It runs again on the 1st as a catch-up: a statement cannot state a month
    that has not been raised, so a failed 25th or 28th has to be repaired
    before the rent falls due on the 5th. Every run bills every month a tenant
    is short of, so a missed trigger is a delay rather than a write-off.

    A period raised in advance is charged, not overdue. Nothing that reports
    debt counts it: the rent roll, the aging table and the unit-status sweep all
    stop at the current calendar month. See billing_calendar.

    The period is raised at the FULL obligation — base rent plus VAT for a
    commercial unit, since that is the figure the tenant actually pays — and any
    credit the tenant has banked from an earlier overpayment is drawn down
    against it, so a prepaying tenant is not billed twice.

    It bills every month a tenant is short of, not just the current one. There
    is no Celery beat in production — a free external scheduler calls the cron
    endpoint (see cron_views) — so a missed or failed trigger used to drop that
    month's rent permanently: the task only ever looked at ``now``, and the
    following month's run would not go back for it. August 2026 was never raised
    for 54 of 82 active tenants, and 10 tenants who moved in after the last run
    had never been billed at all, leaving them invisible to the arrears report
    and the reminders. Catching up makes a missed trigger a delay rather than a
    write-off.

    Returns the number of rows raised, so the cron endpoint's response says what

    Email every active tenant their rent statement with the PDF attached.

    Runs on the 25th and the 28th, and each tenant is sent the month THEIR run
    day has reached: a commercial tenant gets October on 25 September and a
    residential tenant gets October on 28 September, each with September's
    water and each due 5 October. `billing_calendar.tenant_billing_period`
    works out which.

    One run therefore serves both kinds of letting and no run sends twice,
    because the dedupe key is the month STATED. On 25 September a residential
    tenant is still on September, which went out on 28 August, so they are
    skipped; on 28 September a commercial tenant is on October, which went out
    on the 25th, so they are skipped. The catch-up run on the 1st finds
    everyone already sent unless one of those days failed. Nobody has to
    reason about who a given day's run is "for".

    A tenant whose meter has been read before but has no reading for the
    month their invoice carries water for is still sent the invoice — rent
    cannot wait on a meter — and is listed under ``missing_water`` so the
    office can enter the reading. It then appears on the following invoice.

    Schedule this *after* `monthly-arrears` on the same morning: that job is
    what raises the month's rent, and a statement sent before it has run states
    a balance with the stated month missing from it.

    Idempotent per tenant per month via dedupe_key, so re-running the job — or a
    scheduler that fires twice — does not send the same statement again. A
    tenant whose send *failed* is retried on a re-run, which is the whole point
    of keeping the failures on record.

    Tenants with no email address are counted, not recorded: most of the roster
    has no address on file yet, and writing a failure row for each of them every
    month would bury the real failures.

    Every tenant with a phone number is also texted the statement summary —
    including the many with no email, for whom the SMS is the only copy. The SMS
    has its own dedupe key, so one that failed is retried on a re-run even when
    the email already went. STATEMENT_SMS_ENABLED switches the SMS off on its
    own, without stopping the email.

    Returns per-outcome counts, which the cron endpoint echoes in its response so
    the scheduler's log says what actually happened.
