"""
Water billing from meter readings.

Staff capture a meter reading for a unit; the system derives consumption from
the previous reading, prices it at the building's tariff, and bills it as a
``UtilityCharge`` — which posts to the GL (DR 1040 / CR 4150) and appears as
"Other Charges" on the tenant's statement.

Previously the only way a water charge could exist was the spreadsheet importer,
which carried the amount already computed in Excel. There was no tariff, no
calculator, and no staff-facing entry path.

The one invariant everything here defends: **a meter's history is a chain**.
Each month opens exactly where the previous month closed, so consumption is
partitioned across months with no gaps and no double-counting. Break the chain
anywhere and a tenant is billed for water nobody metered.
