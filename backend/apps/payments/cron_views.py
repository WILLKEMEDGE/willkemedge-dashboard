HTTP triggers for the scheduled jobs.

There is no Celery beat process in production. Running one would mean paying for
a Render worker plus a Redis instance, which is hard to justify at this scale, so
a **free** external scheduler (cron-job.org, GitHub Actions, UptimeRobot) calls
these endpoints instead. This generalises the pattern already used by
`reconciliation_views.py`.

    GET|POST /api/payments/cron/<job>/
      Headers:  Authorization: Bearer <CRON_TRIGGER_TOKEN>
      Query:    token=<CRON_TRIGGER_TOKEN>    (alternative; many free cron
                services cannot send custom headers)
      Optional: ?date=YYYY-MM-DD              (daily-reconciliation only)

Jobs run **synchronously** via `.apply()`, so they work with no broker and no
worker, and a failure surfaces as a 500 — which makes the scheduler's run show
red instead of failing silently.

Schedule these to match the old Celery beat schedule (times are EAT):

    00:05, 1st of month   monthly-arrears
    00:30 daily           recalculate-statuses
    08:00 daily           rent-reminders
    09:00 daily           arrears-reminders
    any time daily        daily-reconciliation

`monthly-arrears` is the important one: it is the only thing that creates an
Arrears row for a tenant who has *not* paid. Without it, defaulters produce no
arrears record at all and stay invisible to the reminders and the arrears report.
