HTTP triggers for the scheduled jobs.

There is no Celery beat process in production. Running one would mean paying for
a Render worker plus a Redis instance, which is hard to justify at this scale, so
a **free** external scheduler (cron-job.org, GitHub Actions, UptimeRobot) calls
these endpoints instead. This generalises the pattern already used by
`reconciliation_views.py`.

    GET|POST /api/payments/cron/<job>/
      Headers:  Authorization: Bearer <CRON_TRIGGER_TOKEN>
      Query:    token=<CRON_TRIGGER_TOKEN>    (alternative; many free cron
                services cannot send custom headers)
      Optional: ?date=YYYY-MM-DD              (daily-reconciliation only)

Jobs run **synchronously** via `.apply()`, so they work with no broker and no
worker, and a failure surfaces as a 500 — which makes the scheduler's run show
red instead of failing silently.

Schedule (times are EAT; see .github/workflows/scheduled-jobs.yml):

    06:30, 25th of month  monthly-arrears        (commercial: NEXT month)
    07:00, 25th of month  monthly-statements     (commercial: NEXT month)
    06:30, 28th of month  monthly-arrears        (residential: NEXT month)
    07:00, 28th of month  monthly-statements     (residential: NEXT month)
    06:30, 1st of month   monthly-arrears        (catch-up for both)
    07:00, 1st of month   monthly-statements     (catch-up for both)
    00:30 daily           recalculate-statuses
    08:00 daily           rent-reminders
    09:00 daily           arrears-reminders
    any time daily        daily-reconciliation

Every tenant is invoiced a month ahead: next month's rent and this month's
water, due on the 5th. The arcade is invoiced on the 25th, so its VAT invoice
arrives before the month starts; houses are invoiced on the 28th, with water
read up to that day. The 1st repeats both as a catch-up.
`apps/payments/billing_calendar.py` owns the rule and lists what depends on it.

Both invoice days must be scheduled. Each run covers whichever tenants that day
applies to and skips the rest as already-sent, so dropping either day leaves
that half of the portfolio uninvoiced until the 1st.

Order matters on both days. `monthly-arrears` is what raises the month's rent,
and a statement emailed before it has run states a balance with the stated month
missing from it — hence the half hour between them.

`monthly-statements` accepts an optional `?period=YYYY-MM` to re-issue one month
for everybody; without it each tenant is stated the month their own cycle is on.

`monthly-arrears` is the important one: it is the only thing that creates an
Arrears row for a tenant who has *not* paid. Without it, defaulters produce no
arrears record at all and stay invisible to the reminders and the arrears report.
It bills every month a tenant is short of, so each run is also a free safety net
for the other one having failed.
