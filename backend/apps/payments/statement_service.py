"""
Statement service — builds the full "Customer Rent Statement" payload.

This produces the data behind the rent statement PDF a tenant receives after
every payment (and that the admin can download from the tenant page). The
layout it feeds mirrors the official Wilkem rent statement:

  * branded header (entity name, address, contacts)
  * customer block (name, optional c/o, KRA PIN / ID / phone, unit descriptor)
  * statement summary box (Arrears/Others, Current Month, 16% VAT, Total Due)
  * payment options (M-Pesa Paybill + bank account)
  * a running-balance ledger of every rent charge, VAT line,
    utility (water/electricity) charge, and payment

Ledger rows are derived from stored records only:
  * Arrears        -> "Month Rent - <Mon>-<Year>"  (+ "16% VAT on Rent" for BUSINESS)
  * UtilityCharge  -> "<Label> <Mon. 'YY>" (+ multi-line readings if recorded)
  * Payment        -> "Payment Received"
