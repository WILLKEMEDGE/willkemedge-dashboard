"""
The statement has to show the tenant the money they actually sent.

Deposits were left out of the ledger on the sound reasoning that a refundable
liability must not reduce the rent owed. Dropped from both columns, though, a
tenant who transferred 75,000 got a statement acknowledging 25,000 — Fortcom
(MCF01) exactly. And a single transfer stored as several Payment rows, which is
what FIFO allocation and a deposit/first-month split both produce, printed as
several payments they never made.

The acceptance test is the last one: MCF01's statement as at 1 Sept 2026 must
reproduce the landlord's own document, row for row.
