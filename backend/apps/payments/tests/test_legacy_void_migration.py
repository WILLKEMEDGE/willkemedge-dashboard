    """Run with `payment_amount_positive` lifted.

    This test seeds the state of a database BEFORE this release: a legacy
    reversal written as an equal-and-opposite Payment with a NEGATIVE amount.
    That shape is exactly what the constraint now forbids, and forbidding it is
    the point — but it did not exist when those rows were written, and 0017 runs
    long before 0019 installs it, so the migration legitimately has to cope with
    data the current schema would reject.

    Lifting the constraint for the duration is therefore modelling reality, not
    working around the check. `convert()` deletes the negative rows, so the data
    satisfies the constraint again by the time it is restored — which is itself
    a useful assertion: if the migration left a negative row behind, restoring
    the constraint here would fail.

    NB: `schema_editor.remove_constraint` does NOT work here. On SQLite Django
    implements it by rebuilding the table from the model's `_meta`, which still
    declares the constraint — so it is silently re-created. The backend-specific
    routes below are the ones that actually take effect.
