"""Tenant credits and refunds: numbered documents, never a typed-in balance.

A credit on account has to reach three places at once — the tenant's balance,
the statement PDF, and the books — and each of the five business cases the
owner signed off must come out right in all three:

  A. overpaid 5,000, carried forward to the next invoice
  B. overpaid 5,000, refunded
  C. a 5,000 billing correction, applied to the next invoice
  D. a manual credit the tenant asks to have paid out
  E. a credit partly applied and the rest refunded (then voided)
