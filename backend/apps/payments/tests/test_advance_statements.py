"""The COMMERCIAL cycle: invoiced on the 25th, for the month not yet started.

The arcade's VAT invoice has to be in the tenant's hands before the month it
covers begins, so a commercial letting is billed a month ahead of the calendar:
on 25 August 2026 the system raises September's rent and emails September's
statement. Residential lettings are also billed a month ahead, but on the
28th — covered by test_residential_billing_cycle.py.
See apps/payments/billing_calendar.py.

The three things that have to hold together, and each of which broke the
feature on its own while it was being built:

  * the charge exists before the statement states it — billing on the 1st and
    stating on the 2nd cannot produce a statement for a month that has not
    started;
  * the statement says September, not August — "current month" used to be
    clamped to the month the statement was drawn in;
  * September is charged, not overdue — every debt figure has to stop at the
    current calendar month, or the whole roster reads a month in arrears for
    the last week of every month.
